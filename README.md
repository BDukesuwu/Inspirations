## Wins
- Getting everyone on the same page with working code and Repo.
- Adding Responsive CSS
- User Auth

## Hurdles
- Setting up a working Repository was a struggle for a while, considering we forgot a key factor; the git.ignore file. Once we added one, things became a lot smoother.
- Being able to add an inspiration to a Gallery and display it.

## Future features

- [ ] The ability to delete or edit a note.
